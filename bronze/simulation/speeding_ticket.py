Speeding Ticket

07/10
1. understand the question and the example explaination
2. brianstorm the solution, e.g. what steps you might try

07/15
3. read / parse input and store the input into variable / list - we already did most work in the input_one()
4. print out those variable / list


Key info
1. The road is exactly 100 miles long
2. The road is divided into N segments, each described by a positive integer length in miles, as well as an integer speed limit in the range 1â€¦100 miles per hour
3. Bessie's journey can also be described by a series of segments, M
4. During each segment, she travels for a certain positive integer number of miles, at a certain integer speed

Task: determine the maximum amount over the speed limit that Bessie travels during any part of her journey.
